# SOOS Action

A [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) for using [SOOS](https://soos.io) to check for
vulnerabilities in your projects.

**NOTE** This read-me describes GitHub actions for private repos that intend to house the files themselves. This read-me does not describe how to use the GitHub action after it's published to the GitHub marketplace.

You can use the Action as follows:

**FILE:** YOUR_REPO/.github/workflow/main.yml

```yaml
name: Example workflow using SOOS
# Events required to engage workflow (add/edit this list as needed)
on: push
jobs:
  synchronous-analysis-with-blocking-result:
    name: SOOS Scan
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

    - uses: actions/checkout@master

    - name: Run SOOS - Scan for vulnerabilities
      uses: SOOS/actions/github-action@main
      with:
        project_name: "My Project Name"
      env:
        # Visit https://soos.io to get the required tokens to leverage SOOS scanning/analysis services
        SOOS_CLIENT_ID: ${{ secrets.SOOS_CLIENT_ID }}
        SOOS_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.SOOS_API_KEY }}
        
```

| SOOS_API_KEY | Provided to you when subscribing to SOOS services. |


For example, you can choose to exclude specific directories from scanning:

*YOUR_REPO/.github/workflow/main.yml*
```yaml
name: Example workflow using SOOS
on: 
  push:
    branches: 
      - main 
    paths:
      - package.json
jobs:
  synchronous-analysis-with-blocking-result:
    name: SOOS Scan
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

    - uses: actions/checkout@master

    - name: Run SOOS - Scan for vulnerabilities
      uses: soos-io/soos-ci-analysis-github-actions@main
      with:
        project_name: "My Project Name"
        directories_to_exclude: "custom/bin/, custom/etc/bin/"
    env:
        # Visit https://soos.io to get the required tokens to leverage SOOS scanning/analysis services
        SOOS_CLIENT_ID: ${{ secrets.SOOS_CLIENT_ID }}
        SOOS_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.SOOS_API_KEY }}
```
